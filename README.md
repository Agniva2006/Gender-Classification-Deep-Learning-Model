# Gender-Classification-Machine-Learning-Model-For-Comys-Hackathon-2025
This project fine-tunes a pretrained ResNet-18 convolutional neural network to classify gender (male/female) from facial images. The model is trained using PyTorch, with custom data augmentation and class balancingÂ strategies.
# ðŸš€ Hackathon Task A: Gender Recognition (Folder-wise Matching)
#pls download task_a ipynb notebook due to its huge size
#weights and biases for preatrained resnet-18 model are in txt file in details

## ðŸ“Œ Task Objective:

> * Train a model to accurately classify the gender of a face image*

###  Success Criteria:

* if image is male , output is 1
* if image is female,output is 0                                         



## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Structure:


/train/
    /male/
     maleX.jpg
     /female/
     femaleY.jpg

/val/
    /male/
     male1.jpg
     /female/
     female1.jpg


* Each folder = 1 unique individual
  Val contains persons not present in train
* male and female images are in the the training and validation folder

## ðŸ“Œ Solution Approach (Pre-train Resnet18 model):

|steps:
1.transformed the dataset and prepare the data for pytorch
          2.due to 1623 male and 303 female images i have made weights for each sample
      3.use the pretrained resnet18
   4.training,classification,accuracy

## ðŸ“Œ Result:

|Final Validation Metrics (Task A - Gender Classification):
|             | precision|    recall|  f1-score|   support|

|      female|       0.79|      0.76|      0.77|       79|
|        male|       0.95|     0.95|     0.95|       343|

|    accuracy|                     |     0.92|      422|
|   macro avg|       0.87|      0.86|      0.86|       422|
|weighted avg|       0.92 |     0.92|     0.92|       422|

* Validation Accuracy: 91.71% *


## ðŸ“Œ How to Run:

1.  Upload dataset to Google Colab (train + val folders)
2.  Run FaceNet Cosine Matching notebook
3.  The notebook will:

   * Evaluate val set
4.  For custom testing â†’ Upload any image â†’ Run final test cell

---

## ðŸ“Œ Extra: Test on Any Distorted Image:

* Predicted label (1 or 0)(Male:1,Female:0)
* try to minimize training and validation accuracy gap to prevent overfitting
